# ü•™ Five Star Delis - Hacktoberfest Project

Welcome to **Five Star Delis**: a Hacktoberfest project aimed at providing NYC delis with a modern, streamlined tool for generating their own static brochure websites. We'll be building a **full-stack Rust/Yew** application focused on clean code, modularity, and performance.

Our goal is to have a fully functional, polished MVP by the end of four weeks ‚Äî driven by robust development, testing, and community feedback.

## üöÄ Project Objectives

### Week 1: Project Kickoff & Foundations
- **Introduction & Overview**: Discuss the project architecture, development roadmap, and project goals.
- **Environment Setup**: Configure your local development environment with Rust, Yew, and all necessary dependencies. Ensure proper versioning and reproducibility.
- **Data Model Implementation**: Implement core data structures, such as `Bodega`, `FeatureGroup`, and `HoursTable`. Begin building out the foundation of the application logic.
- **UI Scaffolding**: Develop the basic structure in Yew, including form layout, navigation, and component hierarchies.
- **Version Control & Contribution Guidelines**: Set up repository standards for branching, code style, and PR review processes. Efficient Git workflows are critical.
- **Discord Setup**: Join the project-specific Discord channel for streamlined communication, collaboration, and technical discussions.

*By the end of Week 1, we aim to have the groundwork established for a modular Yew-based application with a clear path forward.*

### Week 2: Developing Core UI & Site Generation
- **Form Development for Deli Data**: Design and implement form components for customizing a deli's website (e.g., hours, features, descriptions).
- **Data Model/UI Integration**: Establish bi-directional data flow between the UI and Rust structs, ensuring real-time updates to `Bodega` data models.
- **Preview Renderer**: Build a live preview pane for visualizing static site changes as data is input.
- **Static Site Generation**: Implement functionality to export form data into clean, SEO-friendly HTML.

*By the end of Week 2, participants should be able to input data into a form and generate a corresponding static site.*

### Week 3: Styling, Hosting, & MVP Rollout
- **Styling & Design Refinement**: Apply modern, professional styles to the UI using tools like **Tailwind CSS**. Aim for a responsive, user-focused design to fit contemporary convenience store aesthetics.
- **Domain & Subdomain Support**: Implement routing logic for either custom domains or subdomains (e.g., `bedforddeli.fivestardelis.com`).
- **Map View for Member Delis**: Create a centralized view on `fivestardelis.com` with map-based visualizations of all member delis.
- **Initial Testing & Feedback**: Start testing the MVP with mock data, focusing on usability, edge cases, and UX refinement.

*By the end of Week 3, the MVP will be ready for real-world testing with key functionality in place.*

### Week 4: Polishing, Testing, & Finalization
- **Bug Fixes & Refinements**: Address issues found during testing, including UI/UX enhancements and performance tuning.
- **Optimize Static Site Generation**: Ensure that generated HTML/CSS is performant, semantic, and accessible.
- **Map Enhancements & Listing Details**: Improve the map-based listing view with additional interactivity (e.g., tooltips, detailed info on hover/click).
- **Documentation & User Guide**: Draft technical documentation, contributing guides, and user manuals for deli owners.
- **Final Demonstration & Showcasing**: Present the polished MVP with full functionality, from form input to generated static site.

*By the end of Week 4, we expect to have a polished, production-ready tool, ready for deli owners to utilize.*

## üìã Participation & Contribution
- **Technical Contributors**: We need senior engineers comfortable with Rust and Yew, familiar with full-stack development, and capable of contributing to both front-end and back-end functionality.
- **Non-Technical Participants**: In addition to code contributions, we're also looking for individuals who can assist with:
  - **UI/UX Design**: Skilled designers who can refine the look and feel of the platform.
  - **Product Testing & QA**: Participants who can stress-test the application, identify edge cases, and provide feedback on functionality.
  - **User Research & Outreach**: Individuals who can connect with deli owners, understand their needs, and advocate for real-world requirements.

If your skills lie outside the technical realm, there is still an opportunity to make a meaningful contribution. 

## üõ† Tech Stack & Tools
- **Rust**: Back-end and logic for data models, handling static site generation.
- **Yew**: Modern front-end framework for building reactive web components in Rust.
- **Tailwind CSS** (or similar): Styling framework for responsive and contemporary UI design.
- **Hosting & Domain Management**: Static site generation with the capability to support custom domains or subdomains on `fivestardelis.com`.

## üéØ Key Features to Implement
1. **Customizable Deli Profiles**: Easily define hours, features, and descriptions for a deli.
2. **Static Site Generation**: Generate clean, responsive HTML/CSS based on user input.
3. **Dynamic, Map-Based View of Members**: Visualize all registered delis on an NYC map with one listing per block.
4. **Modern, Contemporary UI**: Design language that appeals to the energetic, convenience-based consumer.
5. **Exclusive Listing on fivestardelis.com**: Each block in NYC will have one deli representative, adding a sense of exclusivity.

## üí¨ Communication & Support
Join our **Discord channel** for technical discussions, announcements, and real-time collaboration. Our weekly 2-hour coding sessions in Bed-Stuy will also provide a focused environment for building and refining the product.

## ü§ù Contributing & Issues
To get started:
- Read the `CONTRIBUTING.md` guide for setup instructions, code style, and submission guidelines.
