# 🥪 Five Star Delis - Hacktoberfest Project

Welcome to the **Five Star Delis** Hacktoberfest project! 🎉 We're building a full-stack application using **Rust** and **Yew** to help NYC delis generate beautiful, static brochure websites. 

By the end of Hacktoberfest, we aim to deliver a complete tool that allows deli owners to customize their site with their business hours, features, and details — then host their site either on their custom domain or on a subdomain of `fivestardelis.com`.

## 🚀 Project Goals

### Week 1: Project Kickoff & Foundations
- **Introduction & Overview**: Understand the project goals, roadmap, and outcomes.
- **Environment Setup**: Get started with Rust, Yew, and all required tools.
- **Data Model Implementation**: Create core structs for `Bodega`, `FeatureGroup`, `Feature`, `HoursTable`, etc.
- **UI Scaffolding**: Build the initial layout in Yew, including navigation, forms, and preview sections.
- **Version Control & Contribution Guidelines**: Learn about our Git flow, coding standards, and how to contribute effectively.

*By the end of Week 1, we will have a functioning development environment and the basic structure of our application.*

### Week 2: UI Components & Static Site Generation
- **Form Components for Deli Data**: Develop customizable forms for hours, features, and description.
- **Connect Data Models to UI**: Ensure changes in the UI update the `Bodega` data models in real-time.
- **Live Preview of Static Site**: Render a live preview of the static site based on input data.
- **Implement Static Site Generation**: Add functionality to export the form data as static HTML.

*By the end of Week 2, users will be able to create their deli's static site through a form-based UI.*

### Week 3: Styling, Hosting, & MVP Release
- **Styling & Design Polishing**: Apply modern, energetic CSS to make the UI contemporary and user-friendly.
- **Domain & Subdomain Hosting**: Integrate support for custom domains or subdomains on `fivestardelis.com`.
- **Map View of All Delis**: Create a map view on `fivestardelis.com` listing all member delis.
- **MVP Testing & Feedback**: Test the app with mock data and gather feedback on functionality and design.

*By the end of Week 3, the MVP will be ready for deli owners to generate and host their sites.*

### Week 4: Polishing, Bug Fixes, & Finalization
- **Bug Fixes & Refinements**: Fix issues found during MVP testing; refine the UI/UX.
- **Enhance Site Generation**: Optimize the static site generation process.
- **Improve Map & Listing Details**: Add interactivity and details to the map view.
- **Documentation & User Guide**: Write comprehensive documentation for contributors and users.
- **Final Demo & Showcase**: Present the polished MVP and the end-to-end cycle of generating a deli site.

*By the end of Week 4, we'll have a polished, bug-free, and fully documented deli website generator.*

## 📋 How to Participate
