# ü•™ Five Star Delis - Hacktoberfest Project

Welcome to **Five Star Delis**: a Hacktoberfest project dedicated to empowering NYC delis with modern, easy-to-use brochure websites. We're building a **full-stack Rust/Yew** application that focuses on clean code, modularity, and high performance, aiming for an MVP that's robust, polished, and ready for deli owners to use by the end of four weeks.

## üöÄ Project Objectives

### Week 1: Project Kickoff & Foundations
- **Introduction & Overview**: Discuss project architecture, development roadmap, and objectives.
- **Environment Setup**: Configure your development environment with Rust, Yew, and all necessary dependencies for reproducibility and version control.
- **Data Model Implementation**: Implement core data structures (`Bodega`, `FeatureGroup`, `HoursTable`), laying down the foundation for application logic.
- **UI Scaffolding**: Develop the basic Yew structure, including form layouts, navigation, and component hierarchies.
- **Version Control & Contribution Guidelines**: Set up repository standards for branching, code style, and PR reviews to ensure smooth collaboration.
- **Discord Setup**: Join our project Discord for streamlined communication and discussions.

*By the end of Week 1, the groundwork will be laid for a modular Yew-based application with a clear development path.*

### Week 2: Developing Core UI & Site Generation
- **Form Development for Deli Data**: Design and implement form components for customizing a deli‚Äôs online profile.
- **Data Model/UI Integration**: Establish bidirectional data flow between UI components and Rust structs, ensuring real-time updates to `Bodega` models.
- **Preview Renderer**: Create a live preview pane to visualize static site changes as data is updated.
- **Static Site Generation**: Implement functionality to export form data into clean, SEO-optimized HTML.

*By Week 2's end, participants should be able to input form data and generate a functional static site.*

### Week 3: Styling, Hosting, & MVP Rollout
- **Styling & Design Refinement**: Utilize tools like **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive, user-friendly design that matches the deli aesthetic.
- **Domain & Subdomain Support**: Implement routing for custom domains and subdomains (e.g., `bedforddeli.fivestardelis.com`).
- **Map View for Member Delis**: Build a centralized map-based view on `fivestardelis.com` showcasing all member delis.
- **Initial Testing & Feedback**: Start testing the MVP with mock data to refine usability and address edge cases.

*By Week 3, the MVP should be ready for real-world testing with core features in place.*

### Week 4: Polishing, Testing, & Finalization
- **Bug Fixes & Refinements**: Address feedback from testing, enhance UI/UX, and optimize performance.
- **Optimize Static Site Generation**: Ensure generated HTML/CSS is performant, semantic, and accessible.
- **Map Enhancements & Listing Details**: Improve the map-based listing with interactivity (tooltips, detailed info on hover/click).
- **Documentation & User Guide**: Write comprehensive technical documentation and user guides for both developers and deli owners.
- **Final Demonstration & Showcasing**: Present the fully functional MVP, from form input to live static site generation.

*By the end of Week 4, we expect to have a production-ready tool for deli owners.*

## üìã Participation & Contribution
- **Technical Contributors**: We're looking for engineers who are comfortable with Rust and Yew, and can contribute to both the front-end and back-end. Experience with full-stack development is a plus.
- **Non-Technical Participants**: Contributions beyond code are highly valued:
  - **UI/UX Design**: Help refine the platform's look and feel.
  - **Product Testing & QA**: Stress-test the app, identify edge cases, and provide functional feedback.
  - **User Research & Outreach**: Engage with deli owners to understand their needs and advocate for user-centric features.

If your skills lie outside the technical realm, your insights and feedback can greatly enhance the project!

## üõ† Tech Stack & Tools
- **Rust**: For back-end logic and data model handling.
- **Yew**: A modern front-end framework for building interactive web components in Rust.
- **Tailwind CSS** (or similar): For responsive, contemporary UI design.
- **Hosting & Domain Management**: Static site generation with custom domain/subdomain support on `fivestardelis.com`.

## üéØ Key Features to Implement
1. **Customizable Deli Profiles**: Simple forms to define hours, features, and descriptions.
2. **Static Site Generation**: Generate clean, responsive HTML/CSS based on user input.
3. **Dynamic Map View of Delis**: Visualize all member delis on an NYC map with exclusive block representation.
4. **Modern, Engaging UI**: A design aesthetic that appeals to vibrant, convenience-focused consumers.
5. **Exclusive Listings**: Each NYC block will feature one deli, providing exclusivity and visibility.

## üí¨ Communication & Support
